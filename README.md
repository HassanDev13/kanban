### About the Project  
At **[Algerien Tech Makerst](https://www.linkedin.com/company/algerian-tech-makers/posts/?feedView=all)**, we are tech volunteers who have always used Trello to manage our work. However, recent limitations on the platform have impacted our workflow. To overcome this, I started developing an open-source alternative, aiming to replicate Trello’s user experience (UX) while keeping it free and accessible.

### How to Run the Project  
Start the development server using one of the following commands:  

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.  
You can customize the app by editing `app/page.tsx`. Changes will be reflected automatically.

### Key Technologies  
This project utilizes:  
- **[dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/)** – A lightweight, modular, and highly customizable drag-and-drop toolkit for React, enabling Trello-like functionality.
